    "Haley.indoornight.221": "Poor Clint... Emily told me he won't stop leaving her gifts and love notes. It's sweet, but also kind of creepy.$s#$b#I feel bad for the guy, unrequited love is tough.

    "Haley.indoornight.227": "You know, it's funny... Emily and I used to fight like cats and dogs over the silliest things.#$b#Like who got to use the bathroom first or whose turn it was to pick what we watched on TV.#$b#But now that we don't live together anymore, all those little annoyances seem so trivial.#$b#I guess absence really does make the heart grow fonder... Either that or marriage has just made me a lot more zen about things.",
    "Haley.indoornight.228": "You're back late! Did you bring me something sparkly from the mines?#$b#Just kidding, sort of. I'd settle for a kiss right now.$l",
    "Haley.indoornight.229": "I saw a rainbow today and thought about how far I've come.#$b#From that shallow girl who only cared about shopping to... well, a slightly less shallow girl who's madly in love with a farmer.$11",

    "Haley.indoornight.237": "Remember when you gave me that first sunflower?$h#$b#I still have it pressed in my diary. Right next to where I wrote 'cute farmer alert' with hearts around it.$l",
    "Haley.indoornight.238": "Hey you. I've been counting down the minutes until you got home.#$b#%Haley pulls you into a deep, deep kiss. It's not a hello kiss. It's messy and fierce, an 'I've been thinking about you nonstop' kiss.",
    "Haley.indoornight.239": "I had the most amazing nap today! I swear, being a farmer's wife is the life.$h#$b#Wake up, have some coffee, take a nap, maybe do a little cleaning...#$b#It's a tough job, but someone's gotta do it.$11",
    "Haley.indoornight.240": "I caught Penny gazing at you across the fields today. She looked so wistful... it's almost like she knows exactly what she's missing out on.#$b#But don't worry, I made sure to remind her, with a little wink, that you're all mine.$h",
    "Haley.indoornight.241": "I did some online shopping today...$h#$b#But before you panic, it was sunflower seeds! Aren't you proud?#$b#...and maybe one tiny designer handbag.$l",
    "Haley.indoornight.242": "You're home late... again.$s#$b#I was starting to get bored waiting for you. A girl has needs, you know?",

    "Haley.indoornight.247": "So Emily came over today and decided to give me a 'spiritual cleanse', which basically meant burning incense and chanting around the house.$s#$b#I love my sister, but she's such a weirdo. I'm just glad she didn't try to sage my designer handbag collection!$h",
    "Haley.indoornight.248": "I know this is gonna sound silly, but sometimes I still can't believe we ended up together like this.#$b#%Haley intertwines her fingers with yours, studying them in the flickering firelight.#$b#Like... if things had gone just a little differently, I might have been with Alex right now instead of your wife.$s#$b#Thank Yoba I came to my senses in time.",

    "Haley.affection.neutral.65": "It's amazing how much this farm has changed since we started working on it together. It feels like our own little world out here.$h#$b#Maybe we could build a little gazebo someday, just for us to relax in. What do you think?",
    "Haley.affection.neutral.66": "Can we talk later? I'm a little stressed right now, but I want to spend some quality time with you.$s#$b#Maybe after I finish my chores?",
    "Haley.affection.neutral.67": "Did you see that cute little robin hopping around by the coop this morning? It reminded me of you - bright and cheerful!#$b#Maybe we could put up a bird feeder outside our bedroom window?",

    "Haley.affection.neutral.84": "Do you ever wonder what life would be like if we lived somewhere else? Maybe a beach house with a view of the ocean...",
    "Haley.affection.neutral.85": "Ugh, I think I left my good gardening gloves in the greenhouse again. Do you mind grabbing them for me when you head out there today?",
    "Haley.affection.neutral.86": "Sometimes I feel like we don't spend enough time together anymore.$s#$b#Between the farm and all the other things going on, it's hard to find time for each other.$s#$b#Maybe we should schedule a date night? Just us two. No distractions.",

    "Haley.affection.neutral.92": "I think it's kinda funny how everyone expects me to be some sort of expert on farming just because I married you.#$b#Like, honey, I can barely tell the difference between a tomato and a pepper.$h",
    "Haley.affection.neutral.93": "Remember that time when we accidentally set the kitchen on fire while trying to bake a cake? Good times...$h#$b#I still can't believe how calm you were about it! You saved us from burning down the whole house.",
    "Haley.affection.neutral.94": "I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives?",
    "Haley.affection.neutral.95": "Can we please stop using plastic bags at Pierre's? It just makes me feel so guilty.

    "Haley.affection.neutral.96": "Can I be totally honest with you for a sec? Sometimes I feel like you're not really listening when we talk...$s#$b#Like your mind is always somewhere else and you're just waiting for me to finish so you can get back to harvesting, or fishing, or mining, or wharever...$s#$b#I'm sure it's nothing personal, but it would mean a lot if you could make more of an effort to be present in our conversations.$s#$b#Your mind's always on the farm...",
    "Haley.affection.neutral.97": "You know I love you, right? Even when you're grumpy and covered in hay.#$b#It's just... sometimes it feels like we don't have enough time for each other anymore.#$b#I guess that's what happens when you run a farm. But maybe we could try to carve out some more quality time together?",
    "Haley.affection.neutral.98": "I've been meaning to organize our pantry. It's gotten a little out of hand!#$b#Do you mind helping me out this afternoon? I know it's not the most exciting thing to do, but we could put on some music and make it fun.",
    "Haley.affection.neutral.99": "Sometimes I feel like I'm not contributing enough around here. You work so hard on the farm, and I just...$s",

When did we lose that spark?#$b#I don't want to imagine a future without you in it, but something has to change.$s",
